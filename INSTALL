Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need:

	A working version of ncurses and an ascii compliant terminal.
	Vifm will currently not work with Solaris curses or with PDcurses.

Basic Installation:

	./configure
	make
	("su" if you don't have access to /usr/local/bin)
	make install

	You can install vifm in your ~/ directory if you prefer.  
		Copy the vifm and pauseme executables to where you want to run them.
		You will also need to copy vifm help files and vifmrc file to ~/.vifm.

	When you start vifm for the first time, you should edit the configuration 
	file.  It will be at ~/.vifm/vifmrc02.


Vim Specific Options:

	If you use vim, copy the vifm.txt file in the vifm/src directory to 
	your ~/.vim/doc directory or the system vim/doc directory. 
	Then launch vim ahd give the command
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc
	or
	:helptags path/to/system/vim/doc 
	depending on where you installed the vifm.txt file.

	You will also need to change the USE_VIM_HELP
	in ~/.vifm/vifmrc as the default setting is to use the plain text file.

	If you want to use the vifm.vim plugin, copy the vifm.vim plugin script to 
	either the system wide vim/plugin or to ~/.vim/plugin/.  The vifm.vim script 
	allows you to use vifm from vim to select files.  The vifm.vim script is not
	installed by default and must be manually copied to the plugin directory.
