From 0.3a-1 on this package provides the vim addon vifm, but it is not enabled
per default. If you want to enable it for your user account just execute

  vim-addons install vifm

Similarly, to enable it for all users of this system just execute (as root)

  vim-addons -w install vifm

vim-addons is provided by the vim-addon-manager package, have a look at its
manpage for more information.
