   Debian-scpecific configuration
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


When you start vifm for the first time, a subdirectory ~/.vifm is created
with a personal config file vifmrc0.1 and a Trash folder. You should edit
the configuration file to match your preferences.


   Vim Specific Options:

If you use vim, copy the vifm.txt file in the vifm/src directory to your
~/.vim/doc directory or the system vim/doc directory.  Then launch vim and
give the command
  :helptags ~/.vim/doc
or
  :helptags path/to/system/vim/doc 
depending on where you installed the vifm.txt file.

You will also need to change the USE_VIM_HELP in ~/.vifm/vifmrc as the
default setting is to use the plain text file.

If you want to use the vifm.vim plugin, copy the vifm.vim plugin script to
either the system wide vim/plugin or to your personal ~/.vim/plugin/
directory.  The vifm.vim script allows you to use vifm from vim to select
files.  The vifm.vim script is not installed by default and must be
manually copied to the plugin directory.
